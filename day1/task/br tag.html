    <p>Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society.<br> 
        The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times,<br>
         followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain<br><br><br><br>
          and the development of language during the Ice Age. The invention of the wheel in the <br>
          Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines.<br>
           More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone,<br>
            and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication and ushered in the knowledge economy.
