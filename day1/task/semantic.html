    <article>ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic.<br> 
        It is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, <br>be it
         answer, essay, story, emails, etc. We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence 
         of good writing. The purposes of the paragraph are to<br> give information, to explain something, 
         to tell a story, and to convince someone that our idea is right.
