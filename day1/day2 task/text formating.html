            <h3>Bold and Italic</h3>
            <b>Paragraphs </b>are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
            a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, <p><b>Italic Tags</b>&nbsp;<i>a paragraph is half a page long,</i></p> etc.
             In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is<strong> what constitutes 
             a paragraph.</strong>
