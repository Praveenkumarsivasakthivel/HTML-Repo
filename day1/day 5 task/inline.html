    <p style="color: rgb(30, 5, 139)">Coimbatore is the third largest city of the state, one of the most industrialized cities in
         Tamil Nadu, known as the textile capital of South India or the Manchester of the South India,
          the city is situated on the banks of the river Noyyal, Coimbatore existed even prior to the 2nd
           or 3rd century AD by Karikalan, the first of the early Cholas. Among its other great rulers were
            Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Pandyas, Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings. When Kongunadu fell to the
             British along with the rest of the state, its name was changed to Coimbatore and it is by this 
             name that it is known today,  in  local Tamil language it is also called as Kovai.

             In the rain shadow region of the Western ghats, Coimbatore enjoys a very pleasant climate all 
             the year round, aided by the fresh breeze that flows through the 25 kms long Palakkad gap.
              The rich black soil of the region has contributed to Coimbatoreâ€™s flourishing agriculture
               industry and, it is in fact the successful growth of cotton that served as a foundation 
               for the establishment of its famous textile industry. The first textile mill came as far 
               back as 1888 after that many textile mills were started and provided many employment 
               opportunities to within as well as neighboring Districts. The result has been a strong
                economy and a reputation as one of the greatest industrial cities in South India.
