    <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. 
      "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
      The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part
      of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
