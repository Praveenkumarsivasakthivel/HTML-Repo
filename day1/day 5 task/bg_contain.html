          Here are some paragraphs on nature in English:
          Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of the human activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system.1
          Nature provides us all the natural resources. Nature always gives us something or nothing in return. It also provides us pure water to drink, pure air to breathe, food to eat, and other sources. Fruits and flowers enhance its beauty. Nature is the source of inspiration for many writers and poets.2
           Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.
